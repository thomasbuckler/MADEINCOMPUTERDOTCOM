Jehovah, my thoughts are bothering me today. i feel scared and feel like something is wrong with me. I am at the meeting but feel like i am disconnected from what is happening. i feel very tired and concerned that my future will be filled with grief and anxiety and pain. please bring your kingdom to the earth. before that time, please don't leave me, give me enough energy to help me serve you acceptably, give me enough energy to help out around the house, give me enough energy to study for the meetings and prepare comments or readings. please don't let me fall deeper into scary thoughts and feelings. give me peace through the brothers and sisters and family and the bible and your creation. help me endure my trials successfully
